This directory contains the file `climate-widget-graph.js` which
defines the function `climate_widget_graph()` for displaying a climate
widget graph in an arbitrary DOM element.

The file demo.html is a sample web page (and associated embedded JavaScript code)
that illustrates how to use the function.  You should be able to view that file
in your browser to see the code in action.  Also see the comments in that file
for more detailed instructions.

Note that the data for the graphs is currently hosted at the location
http://climate-widget.nemac.org; this is a temporary hosting
arrangement for use during development only.  Ultimately, the data
will be hosted on climate.gov along with the widget itself.  When
deploying to climate.gov, we can reconfigure the graph code to access
the data from the new location; for now, the default location of
http://climate-widget.nemac.org is hard-wired into the code.
